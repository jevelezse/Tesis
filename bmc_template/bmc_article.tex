The need to understand the biological processes that are involved in different diseases, from the available biological data such as genomic sequences, microarrays, protein interactions, biomedical images among others and the rapid adoption of electronic medical records that provides an opportunity for large-scale research . Therefore, data mining techniques for the discovery of knowledge from obtaining information from different sources are increasingly important in biological and medical research.

\parttitle{Results} %if any
A group model was implemented for 228 patients, and they were associated with the variants for 4813 genes, obtaining 5 groups with their options available in the rules. As an analysis, an analysis of the CFTR
the gene was also carried out by means of association rules and previously obtained groups. This is the search tag the measurements of the frequencies of the population were made in terms of the number of variants present the age, sex, type of variant and the allelic state of the variants. It was found that for the CFTR hay gene without pathogenic variants in the sampled population. A board also created to visualize the groups and the necessary rules for group and a database for variants in exons for Colombian patients.

\parttitle{Conclusions} %if any
Data mining techniques applied to disk support allow an inference of genetics structure the Colombian population and the epidemiological follow-up of the variants and their possible effects in patient's phenotypes.

\section*{Background}
Biological data mining (seen from bioinformatics) is the process of extracting new knowledge (previously unknown) from biological data, this also allows the use of concepts of data mining and automatic learning in theories and applications in research Biological, by deeding the data that are used to be applied, are genomes that come from DNA sequencing, transcriptome sequences that are RNA or proteins that come from inferences and experimental data from chemistry \cite{Farid2016}.

Inferences regarding large amounts of genomic data require analysis of computational tools to interpret data, being one of the most active areas where data mining is used (I understand data mining as the method of extracting information through learning automatic, statistics, artificial intelligence, recognition and visualization patterns) to solve biological problems, some examples where mining techniques have been applied is the classification of genes, the analysis of mutations in cancer and gene expression \cite{Littlefield}.

Clustering techniques of differentially expressed genes have also been applied, vector support machines have been used to associate the interactions between genes and generate biological networks, as well as traditional methodologies for data mining are not precise or efficient and they require new algorithms to be developed and methodologies that respond in a more precise way to a biological question \cite{Zaki2007}. Without forgetting that it is necessary to evaluate the available platforms, the technological tools that allow the implementation of processes that associate data with research and obtain
more generalized results. This should apply to the research requirements to ensure successful implementation \cite{Zaki2007}.

Some of the data mining tasks are: 1. Classification: where the data is classified to a predefined class, 2. Association: see elements that are associated by rules, 3. Grouping or grouping: as the definition of a population of data within a subgroup or group \cite{Littlefield}.

The use of high performance sequencing techniques together with the application of data mining can contribute to the diagnosis of complex diseases such as cancer\cite{Hannah-Shmouni2015,Kawashima2017}.
\section*{Results}
\subsection*{Exploratory analysis}
The exploratory analysis of the information contained in the database was carried out. A sample of 250 patients donated by the Genetix SA laboratory was taken, of which only 228 had the informed consent to use the information for research purposes.

In this section we examine the growth rate of the mean of $Z_0$, $Z_1$ and $Z_2$. In
addition, we examine a common modeling assumption and note the
importance of considering the tails of the extinction time $T_x$ in
studies of escape dynamics.
We will first consider the expected resistant population at $vT_x$ for
some $v>0$, (and temporarily assume $\alpha=0$)

$
 E \bigl[Z_1(vT_x) \bigr]= E
\biggl[\mu T_x\int_0^{v\wedge
1}Z_0(uT_x)
\exp \bigl(\lambda_1T_x(v-u) \bigr)\,du \biggr].$

If we assume that sensitive cells follow a deterministic decay
$Z_0(t)=xe^{\lambda_0 t}$ and approximate their extinction time as
$T_x\approx-\frac{1}{\lambda_0}\log x$, then we can heuristically
estimate the expected value as
%
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqexpmuts}
E\bigl[Z_1(vT_x)\bigr] &=& \frac{\mu}{r}\log x
\int_0^{v\wedge1}x^{1-u}x^{({\lambda_1}/{r})(v-u)}\,du
\nonumber\\
&=& \frac{\mu}{r}x^{1-{\lambda_1}/{\lambda_0}v}\log x\int_0^{v\wedge
1}x^{-u(1+{\lambda_1}/{r})}\,du
\nonumber\\
&=& \frac{\mu}{\lambda_1-\lambda_0}x^{1+{\lambda_1}/{r}v} \biggl(1-\exp \biggl[-(v\wedge1) \biggl(1+
\frac{\lambda_1}{r}\biggr)\log x \biggr] \biggr).
\end{eqnarray}
%
Thus we observe that this expected value is finite for all $v>0$ (also see \cite{koon,khar,zvai,xjon,marg}).
